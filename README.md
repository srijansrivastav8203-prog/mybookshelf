## How to deploy (free on Render.com)

### Step 1 — Put the code on GitHub
1. Create a free account at github.com
2. Create a new repository (e.g. `my-bookshelf`)
3. Upload all these files to it (drag & drop in the GitHub UI, or use Git)

### Step 2 — Deploy on Render
1. Go to **render.com** and sign up for free
2. Click **New → Web Service**
3. Connect your GitHub repo
4. Render will auto-detect the settings from `render.yaml`
5. Before deploying, go to **Environment** and set:
   - `ADMIN_PASSWORD` → choose a strong password (only you will use this)
6. Click **Deploy** — it takes ~2 minutes

### Step 3 — Get your URL
Render gives you a free URL like `https://my-bookshelf.onrender.com`

Put that in your **Instagram bio link**! 🎉

## How to use it

### Adding books (you only)
1. Go to `your-url.onrender.com/admin`
2. Enter your admin password
3. Fill in the book details, upload the PDF, and hit **Add to shelf**

### What visitors see
- `your-url.onrender.com` → the public shelf
- They can filter by genre, see your ratings & reviews, and open the PDF

---

## Running locally (optional, for testing)

```bash
cd bookshelf
pip install -r requirements.txt
ADMIN_PASSWORD=mypassword python app.py
```

Then open `http://localhost:5000`

---

## Changing your password

On Render, go to your service → **Environment** → change `ADMIN_PASSWORD` → **Save** (redeploys automatically).

## Notes

- PDFs are stored on Render's disk. The free tier includes 1 GB of disk space.
- `books.json` is the database — it lives on the same disk.
- Max PDF size is 50 MB per file.
